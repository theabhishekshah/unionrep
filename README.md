<sub><i>Task-First, Social-Second</i></sub>

## **UnionRep**: A Hub for Purpose-Driven Collaboration
- A **collaborative unionizing platform**, blending the spontaneity of social connection with the utility of a task-oriented tool. 

### **Core Concept**
UnionRep is a digital space where individuals or groups can effortlessly come together to form "unions" for any shared purpose—whether it's planning an event, sharing a hobby, solving a community issue, or embarking on global initiatives. Unlike traditional social media, it minimizes distractions and maximizes meaningful collaboration.

### **Key Features**
1. **Dynamic Union Creation**:
   - Users can create or join temporary or permanent unions around any theme or cause (e.g., planning a trip, organizing charity drives, creating study groups, etc.).
   - A streamlined setup process allows users to define:
     - Purpose of the union.
     - Privacy settings (public, invite-only, or hidden).
     - Duration (temporary for short-term projects or ongoing for long-term purposes).

2. **Task & Resource Sharing**:
   - Built-in tools for assigning roles, sharing to-do lists, and tracking progress.
   - Shared storage for documents, images, and ideas related to the group's purpose.

3. **Focused Communication**:
   - A clean, distraction-free chat window tailored to the union's purpose.
   - Nested threads for detailed discussions without clutter.
   - Voice/video conferencing for real-time collaboration.

4. **Global Connection with Local Roots**:
   - Filters to find or join unions based on location, interests, or language preferences.
   - Cross-border collaboration tools with language translation and time-zone adjustment features.

5. **User Profiles for Shared Interests**:
   - Profiles emphasize skills, interests, and causes instead of "social clout."
   - Opt-in recommendations for unions based on common passions or expertise.

6. **Event Planning**:
   - Integration with calendars to schedule events, meetings, or deadlines.
   - Budgeting tools to split expenses or track contributions (e.g., for group trips or parties).

7. **Purpose-Driven Interface**:
   - Union-based activity only appears in a specific dashboard—no feeds, likes, or dopamine-driven engagement tactics.
   - Notifications are limited to essential updates, ensuring focus.

8. **Global Collaboration Features**:
   - Ability to host discussions or projects with people worldwide.
   - Cross-union collaborations for large-scale initiatives (e.g., an international book club or a global eco-awareness campaign).
